# ABSTRACT
Recognizing emotions awakens interest, since knowing what others feel lets us interact with them more effectively, by analyzing individuals’ behavior.
In our project we are going to apply Deep learning models on audio recordings to recognition speech emotion from Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). 

## Dataset Description 
1440 speech files and 1012 Song files from RAVDESS dataset. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions.


## Models
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs)
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

##TOOLS
•	Google Collab
•	Python
•	Google drive 
•	HTML
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	MATLAB
•	Tableau

## CONCLUSION
NN contributes to robust speech recognition implementation in a real-world environment, led to very good performance on a variety of problems, such as audio recognition.
